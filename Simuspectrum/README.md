# Transmission-spectrum-Rb-Cell
programs and GUI to understand the parameter's impact on the Transmission of a Rb87 and 85 cell.

# How to use the code ?  
You can wait the exec version or you can take the classspectrum.py and the last version of the interface (called main program). 

1 - If you're using an IDE put the interface file in a directory in your IDE directory (advice) 
2 - Create a directory where your main program is and name it "CLassSpectrum" 
3 - Put classspectrum in ClassSpectrum 
4 - create a new file exactly named "_init_.py" and he absolutly needs to be empty

# What this app ?

The first goal is to explain to new workers the impact of parameters T[K] and L[mm] on the transmission. We can optimise the transmission  
The second goal is to change some parameters from the app like the cell's temperature.
